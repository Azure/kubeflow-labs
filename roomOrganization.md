**Highly dependent on the number of attendees**, will we get an estimated number at some point?

# Room Organization

* 3 proctors, each one responsible for a third of the attendees (Do we need more proctors? Sertac?)
* Ideally, each attendee will create it's own cluster and go through all the steps
* If too many attendees, group them by 2, 3 maximum.

## Azure Subscriptions:

* Can we assume that each attendees has a valid internal subscription that can create an AKS cluster with 3 NC6 VMs inside?
* If there are many attendees (more than ~50), each proctor will be assigned a region containing GPUs (southcentralus, eastus..) and will be responsible to ensure that all the attendees create their cluster in this region to avoid exhausting the resources of a single DC.


## Others:
* Will the room be free after the talk? If yes, proctors could stay for another 30min to help people lagging behind or that want to try more stuff and that don't have any other session after.
